# 2.3.2 Request Training

To request flight training on an aircraft, simply pick an appropriate instructor from the list of 2.3.3 or just the type you want to have a session on and write an E-Mail to greif.airlines@googlemail.com, send a message to Administrator FlightCrewTraining on the Newsky chat or our Discord channel.

If you want to have guidance in FlightPlanning contact Administrator FlightPlanning via the same channels.

In case you want to qualify for any of the open positions (1.1.2), send a message to the person the position would be reporting to.
