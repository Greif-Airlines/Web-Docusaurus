# 2.3.1 Objectives and Strategies

At GAGAG, training is a cornerstone of our shared pursuit of excellence, being an informed and learning culture. It is not only about improving individual skills, but also about growing together as a community. Our training initiatives aim to deepen knowledge, promote mutual learning, feedback and support our “as real as it gets” goal, as outlined in the Preamble.

Especially for newcomers to the flight simulation world, the first steps are overwhelming, that’s why we strive to offer a welcoming and structured introduction, building confidence, understanding and capability progressively.

But training at Greif does not stop in the flight deck. It extends to all areas of virtual airline operations: from creating realistic flight plans via tools like SimBrief, to mastering new systems and software features together, and even qualifying and training for roles in our Management team.
