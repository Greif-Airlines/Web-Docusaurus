# 2.2.3 Simulation of ab/non-normal situations

Prior preparation prevents poor performance!

The reenactment of simple or complex ab/non-normal and MEL/CDL procedures is highly appreciated, in order to expand one’s skills. It must be assured that the pilot can operate the respective aircraft in all its normal operations safely, prior commencing such maneuvers. However, it should only be carried out if sufficient information (such as Checklists, FCOM, SOP Manuals) are available or distributed by the aircraft’s manufacturer (e.g. Fenix), in order to prepare oneself for the intended operation thoroughly.

Please take this seriously, before simulating aircraft’s limited capabilities on online networks, as you represent the whole GAGAG by using our callsigns. Caution is to be exercised while logging flights as per 1.2.3, consider declaring an emergency on the Newsky tool.

Refer to chapter 2.3 for help.
