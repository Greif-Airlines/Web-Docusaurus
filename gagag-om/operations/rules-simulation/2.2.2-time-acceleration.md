# 2.2.2 Time Acceleration

The acceleration of time of the simulated flight environment is generally allowed, but only in the cruise phase of flight. However, it is not recommended, as we aim for an as real as it gets operation. Caution is to be exercised for the logging/grading of flights as per 1.2.3.

Time acceleration is as per common sense entirely forbidden during operations on online networks such as VATSIM.
