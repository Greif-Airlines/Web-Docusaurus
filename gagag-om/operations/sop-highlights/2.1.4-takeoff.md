# 2.1.4 Takeoff

## 2.1.4.1 Hand off lever policy

If a takeoff is performed with the logic that a takeoff decision speed (V1) has to be defined, the thrust levers must be **released (hands off)** in order to **not reduce thrust on the remaining engine(s)** in a startle or inadvertent situation.

They may be manipulated (hands on) again from:

- The selection of gear up (retractable undercarriage), or
- Passing 400ft AGL.

This may only be omitted to set full thrust on live engine(s) for safety reasons to ensure a safe climb out.
