# 2.1.9 Taxi-In, Shutdown and De-briefing

## 2.1.9.1 Reduced Engine Taxi In

All GAGAG pilots are asked to shut down as many engines as possible during taxi in after landing, preferably starting with the outboard engines.

- Leave adequate time for ventilating / cool-down idling periods (minimum 2 minutes) after thrust reverser / beta range selection for landing roll.
- Consider safety limitations (e.g. wet surfaces, high aircraft masses, high airfield elevation).
- It is **not allowed** to cross active runways with less than the maximum number of installed engines running.
