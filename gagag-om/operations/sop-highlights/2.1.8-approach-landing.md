# 2.1.8 Approach and Landing

## 2.1.8.1 Stabilised approach criteria

All GAGAG flights are subject to a stabilisation requirement during the final approach.

### Lowest gates to achieve stabilisation:

- **500 ft ARTE** for approach category A & B aircraft  
  *(may be lowered to 250 ft ARTE for circle-to-land procedures)*
- **1000 ft ARTE** for category C & D aircraft  
  *(may be lowered to 500 ft ARTE for circle-to-land procedures)*
- **2000 ft ARTE** for category E aircraft  
  *(may be lowered to 1000 ft ARTE for circle-to-land procedures)*

### Criteria to be met:

- Tracking on the required lateral and vertical approach path and profile:
    - **ILS, MLS, GBAS, SBAS – PA operations**
        - Glideslope < ½ dot
        - Localizer / Azimuth < ½ dot
    - **APV 3D and NPA 2D operations**
        - Crosstrack / Angular < 0.15 NM / 5°
        - Vertical Track < 75 ft
- In the required landing configuration
- Flying with an appropriate attitude
- Flying with a rate of descent adequate for the vertical tracking of the final approach
- Flying at an approach speed between *VAPP - 5 kt* and *VAPP + 10 kt*
    - (VAPP = VREF + ½ steady headwind component + full gust increment)
    - Minimum correction: VREF + 5 kt
    - Maximum approach speed: VREF + 15 kt
- Flying with appropriate thrust/power and trim settings
- Checklists (before landing) completed

**Otherwise, a missed approach must be conducted!**
