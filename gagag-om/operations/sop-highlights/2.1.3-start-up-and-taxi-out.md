# 2.1.3 Start-Up and Taxi-Out

## 2.1.3.1 Reduced Engine Taxi Out

Taxi out procedures with less than the maximum number of installed engines are generally **not allowed**.  
It may only be performed if:

- The anticipated taxi time is **greater than 30 minutes**, or
- The commander deems it necessary for operational reasons.

**All available engines must be functionally running before crossing an active runway.**

## 2.1.3.2 Taxi Speeds

Maximum speeds for ground taxiing are (also applicable for section 2.1.9 Taxi-In):

- **10 kt** for sharp (90Â°) turns
- **15 kt** on aprons/ramps and congested areas
- **30 kt** on straight open taxiways
- **40 kt** on runways for backtracking
- **45 kt** to vacate a landing runway on a high-speed exit taxiway

> Respective aircraft limitations take precedence over these numbers.

## 2.1.3.3 Entering Active Runways

Before entering an active runway (anticipating its status by all available means e.g. ATIS, NOTAMs, etc.), for the intention of crossing, backtracking or lining up for departure, the **Strobe/White Anti-Collision light has to be switched on**.

When entering the runway used for departure, the on-board **ACAS/TCAS system** also has to be switched on in its highest available operating mode and must be switched off again after leaving the landing runway at the destination airport.

> The above-described light policy also applies for section **2.1.9 Taxi-In**.
