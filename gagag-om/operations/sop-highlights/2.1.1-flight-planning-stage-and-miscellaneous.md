# 2.1.1 Flight-Planning Stage and Miscellaneous

## 2.1.1.1 Units

Where the operation of the aircraft allows, GAGAG uses the following units of measurement as standard:

- **Length** = meters (runways/visibility) and nautical miles (distances)
- **Altitude/Height** = feet
- **Speed** = knots
- **Temperature** = degrees centigrade
- **Air pressure** = hectopascal
- **Masses** = kilograms
- **Volumes** = litres

## 2.1.1.2 Delay Codes

GAGAG makes use of the standard IATA Delay codes published here:  
[Wikipedia – IATA Delay Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA_delay_codes)

Pilots are mandated to send a delay code for delays greater than **10 minutes**, in accordance with [section 1.2.7](../1.2.7) or if the automated on-board **ACARS – AOC** system/functions (e.g. *Fenix*) requires it.

### Reporting Format

- Use the **two-digit code** from the matrix, followed by a trailing `0`, if the plain delay code is used.
- If a **free text clarification** is added, use the **letter `A`** instead as the trailing character.

### Special Case: Simulator Issues

- Use `000` or `00A` for:
    - Simulator issues
    - CTD (Crash to Desktop)
    - Similar technical problems

## 2.1.1.3 Standard Passenger Masses

For operation across all GAGAG’s fleet and the respective flight planning, the following **standard passenger masses** are used:

- **80 kg** per passenger
- **20 kg** per passenger baggage

This means that in case of **Last Minute Changes (LMCs)**, the on-/offloading of individuals can easily be calculated as **100 kg per person**.

> All issued **SimBrief profiles** incorporate this standard.

## 2.1.1.4 Standard Taxi Times

Unless otherwise considered necessary by the **commander** or **dispatch** for safety and operational reasons (e.g. online network event), the following **standard taxi times** are used:

- **15 minutes** for taxi out
- **10 minutes** for taxi in

---

## 2.1.1.5 Contingency Fuel

GAGAG dispatches flights with **contingency fuel policies** in line with **EASA standards**. The following options are available:

- **5%** of the trip fuel
- **3%** of the trip fuel, *if a suitable en-route alternate can be selected* according to EASA requirements
- **20 minutes** of planned trip fuel consumption

But at least (if higher than any of the above options):
- **5 minutes** at holding speed at **1500 ft** above the destination aerodrome in **ISA conditions**

> **Note:** All contingency fuel is considered **protected**.  
> This means that the **surplus fuel consumption** for carrying the contingency fuel is **included in the trip fuel consumption**.
